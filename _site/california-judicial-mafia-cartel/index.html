<p>Organized criminal syndicate committing child trafficking, kidnappings, theft, extortion and racketeering under color of law across all California courts - protected by criminals in California Commission on Judicial Performance, California Bar Association, Attorney General Office, and District Attorney Office.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/png/california-judicial-mafia-cartel-map.png"><img src="/assets/png/california-judicial-mafia-cartel-map.png" alt="Map" /></a></p>

<p>This is just a tip of the iceberg - focused on Santa Clara Mafia Cartel, part of California Judicial Mafia Cartel nested in San Jose, Santa Clara County.<br />
Similar structure and patterns of racketeering are well established and documented in many counties of California, including San Francisco, Marin County and others.</p>

<p>I discovered this massive criminal syndicate due to kidnapping of my son Max Mars - who is detained hostage without right for a phone call since kidnapping by criminals from California Judicial Mafia Cartel in September 2022.<br />
While I disqualified three bribed judges - child traffickers Stephen Lowney, Andrea Flint, James Towery, who were extorting passport and documents of my son Max Mars, detaining my son hostage without right for a phone call for long three years, I faced denial of access to all California courts (by Vex Lit), unlawful arrests, arrest and bench warrants from both family and criminal court, theft through unlawful wages garnishment by DCSS, termination of employment, seizure of my 401k, threats of unlafwul incarceration.</p>

<p>My public statement clarifies situation about kidnapping and unlawful detention of my son Max Mars hostage without right for a phone call by organized group of criminals from California Judicial Mafia Cartel and Ukrainian Mafia Cartel “Kodlo Gondona Nahornogo” (“SI Trans Group”).</p>

<p>All those racketeering attacks were coordinated by homosexual presiding judges Beth McGowen and Julie Emede, who at the same time closed Santa Clara County court from public - unconstitutionally denying access to court, and issued orders prohibiting recording of proceedings to prevent victims of child trafficking and racketeering from obtaining any evidence of child trafficking and racketeering by criminals on positions of family and criminal court judges in Santa Clara County.</p>

<p>65 RICO Complaints to Commission on Judicial Performance, 12 Statements of Disqualification against 3 disqualified judges - child traffickers (Stephen Lowney, Andrea Flint, James Towery), 3 Complaints to California Bar Association against 2 lawyers - child traffickers Steven Dinneen and Nancy Roberts, Letters to Attorney General Rob Bonta, District Attorney Jeff Rosen, Governor of California Gavin Newsom - all were dumped without consideration.</p>

<p>Motion to Change Venue to another county, Request to nullify all legally void orders issued post DQ by disqualified judges, Request to Release My Son Max Mars from unlawful detention and prevent international abduction - all were dumped by homosexual presiding judge Beth McGowen, same as she concealed 12 statements of disqualification against child traffickers Stephen Lowney, Andrea Flint, James Towery.</p>

<p>Justice in California is impossible - it was confirmed by Beth McGowen, presiding judge of Santa Clara County Court, Tania Schrag, counsel of Commission on Judicial Performance, Attorney General Rob Bonta and other officials - who simply dumped any letters and requests to assist with releasing my son Max Mars from unlawful detention and prosecute child traffickers who kidnapped my son.</p>

<p>Disqualified child trafficker Stephen Lowney directly threatened me by unlawful incarceration, extorting passport and all documents of my son Max Mars - while detaining my son hostage without right for a phone call under void DVRO.</p>
